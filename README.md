# todolist-k8s

Files used to deploy an infrastructure on Kubernetes.
These files were used only for testing.

Backend: [todolist-api](https://github.com/vinicius-lima/todolist-api)
Frontend: [todolist-angular](https://github.com/vinicius-lima/todolist-angular)

Both backend and frontend Docker images must be locally built before deployment.

Redis is not used so far.
